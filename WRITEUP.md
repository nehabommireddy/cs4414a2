# CS4414 HW 2 - Fast edit distances

You should complete the following questions in your final submission:

## Step 0: Build modes

1. For the dictionary `examples/popular.txt`, how long does it take to
   run the code in the `debug` compilation mode?  What about the
   `release` mode?

Using the naive implementation, the computation time for `popular.txt` was:
Debug: 254.4000348 seconds
Release: 9.9045655 seconds

2. Based on the relative sizes of the dictionaries, estimate how long
   you think it would take to run in the two modes for the
   `examples/enable1.txt` dictionary.  Test your hypothesis in release
   mode; how long does it actually take to run?

The `popular.txt` dictionary contains 25,322 words, while `enable1.txt` contains 172,823 words. The ratio of the dictionary sizes is: 172,823 / 25,322 ≈ 6.83. Since the program compares pairs of words, the amount of computation grows approximately quadratically with the number of words. Therefore, I estimated the runtime ratio as: 6.83² ≈ 46.7.

Based on the `popular.txt` runtimes, my estimated runtimes for `enable1.txt` were:

- Estimated debug runtime: 11,879 seconds
- Estimated release runtime: 462.5 seconds

- Actual release runtime: 659.4675116 seconds


## Step 1: Blocking

1. What is the estimated memory footprint for the two dictionaries
   (`popular.txt` and `enable1.txt`)?  Include the storage for the
   `String` metadata in your accounting (don't worry about storage for
   the allocator's data structures).

A Rust `String` contains 24 bytes of metadata on a 64-bit system: 8 bytes for the pointer, 8 bytes for the length, and 8 bytes for the capacity. Since the dictionary contains ASCII characters, each character requires 1 byte.

For `popular.txt`:
- Number of strings: 25,322
- Character storage: 185,196 bytes
- String metadata: 25,322 × 24 = 607,728 bytes
- Total estimated memory footprint: 792,924 bytes

For `enable1.txt`:
- Number of strings: 172,823
- Character storage: 1,570,540 bytes
- String metadata: 172,823 × 24 = 4,147,752 bytes
- Total estimated memory footprint: 5,718,292 bytes

2. Complete the code for the blocked variant.  You should see a speed
   difference that is noticeable, but not enormous.  What difference
   do you see?

## Step 2: Removing indirection

1. What is the speed difference compared to the method in step 2?

2. The longest word in `enable1.txt` is 28 characters, but most are
   shorter.  If you write your code to reserve one byte for the word
   length at the beginning, what type of performance improvement do
   you see?

## Step 3: Packed representation

What do you see?  Is your version any faster than the
method you explored in Step 2?

## Step 4: Speed demon

Describe the steps that you took to get to your final optimized
version!
